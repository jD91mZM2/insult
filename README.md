# insult

`insult` is the batch/bash "utility" to insult you with a "Oh... Sir! The Insult Simulator"-like fashion!

## Example!

Did you know that `the Royal Family can't exercise because of your sister` or that `your wife probably murdered your husband`?  
Well, me neither.

## Flavors!

This project comes in "flavors". For example, you might wanna have references from TV series in insults...  
Well go ahead, check out this project's [branches](https://github.com/legolord208/insult/branches).

In the future these flavors might become config files instead.
