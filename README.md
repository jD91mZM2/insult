# insult

`insult` is the batch/bash "utility" to insult you with a "Oh... Sir! The Insult Simulator"-like fashion!

## Example!

Did you know that `the Royal Family can't exercise because of your sister` or that `your wife probably murdered your husband`?  
Well, me neither.

## Flavors!

You can edit this project's config files.  
They are located in:  
 - Linux: `~/.config/insult/`
 - Mac OS: `~/Application/Preferences/insult/`
 - Windows, Other: It creates an `insult/` folder in your current directory.

Well go ahead, check out this project's [branches](https://github.com/legolord208/insult/branches) if you want some sample configs.
