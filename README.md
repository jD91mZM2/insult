# insult

`insult` is the batch/bash "utility" to insult you with a "Oh... Sir! The Insult Simulator"-like fashion!

## Example!

Did you know that `the Royal Family can't exercise because of your sister` or that `your wife probably murdered your husband`?  
Well, me neither.

## It's future

C'mmon. It's just a small application. Doesn't really have a future.  
However, I might add some actual command line options...
