# insult - The Oh...Sir!-like insult generator

`insult` is the command line "utility" to insult you with a "Oh... Sir! The Insult Simulator"-like fashion!

## Example!

Did you know that `the Royal Family can't exercise because of your sister` or that `your wife probably murdered your husband`?  
Well, me neither.

## Configs!

You can edit this project's config files.  
They are located in:  
 - Linux: `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` variable (defaults to `~/.config/`), in the sub-directory `insult` (so `~/.config/insult`)
 - Mac OS: `~/Application/Preferences/insult/`
 - Windows, Other: It creates an `insult/` folder in your current directory.

# Installing!

The easiest way to install is with cargo:  
```
cargo install insult
```
